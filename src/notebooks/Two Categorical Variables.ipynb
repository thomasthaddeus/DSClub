    "In this lesson, we will cover ways of examining an association between two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we'll explore a sample of data from the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI-40), a personality test with 40 questions about personal preferences and self-view. There are two possible responses to each question. The sample we'll be working with contains responses to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **influence**: yes = I have a natural talent for influencing people; no = I am not good at influencing people.\n",
    "- **blend_in**: yes = I prefer to blend in with the crowd; no = I like to be the center of attention.\n",
    "- **special**: yes = I think I am a special person; no = I am no better or worse than most people.\n",
    "- **leader**: yes = I see myself as a good leader; no = I am not sure if I would make a good leader.\n",
    "- **authority**: yes = I like to have authority over other people; no = I don't mind following orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, responses to some of these questions are associated. For example, if we know whether someone views themself as a good leader, we may also find that they're more likely to like having authority. In this lesson we'll learn how to assess whether an association exists between any two of these variables."

    "## Contingency Tables: Frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Contingency tables, also known as two-way tables or cross-tabulations, are useful for summarizing two variables at the same time. For example, suppose we are interested in understanding whether there is an association between influence (whether a person thinks they have a talent for influencing people) and leader (whether they see themself as a leader). We can use the crosstab function from pandas to create a contingency table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "influence_leader_freq = pd.crosstab(npi.influence, npi.leader)\n",
    "print(influence_leader_freq)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "leader       no   yes\n",
    "influence            \n",
    "no         3015  1293\n",
    "yes        2360  4429\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This table tells us the number of people who gave each possible combination of responses to these two questions. For example, 2360 people said that they do not see themselves as a leader but have a talent for influencing people.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess whether there is an association between these two variables, we need to ask whether information about one variable gives us information about the other. In this example, we see that among people who don't see themselves as a leader (the first column), a larger number (3015) don't think they have a talent for influencing people. Meanwhile, among people who do see themselves as a leader (the second column), a larger number (4429) do think they have a talent for influencing people.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we know how someone responded to the leadership question, we have some information about how they are likely to respond to the influence question. This suggests that the variables are associated."

We can accomplish this simply by dividing the all the frequencies in a contingency table by the total number of observations (the sum of the frequencies):\n",
